  <p className="about-p">
    In high school, my two children were just regular kids.  In Kurt Vonnegut’s terms, they had neither good nor ill fortune. They were healthy, they got reasonably good grades, and they did what they were supposed to -- not unlike many others.
  </p>
  <p className="about-p">
    One hot summer day, when I was watching them skipping around the soccer field on South P, I suddenly started to think about their future -- Are they going to be alright when they grow up? Are they going to have a career and a rewarding life? At the bare minimum, are they going to be independent financially and not move back in with us after their college?
  </p>
  <p className="about-p">
    I got worried, and I had many reasons to.
  </p>

  <p className="about-p">
    At that time, A large majority of college graduates owed a student loan worth more than two brand new Audi A4 ($72,000) or, in today’s market, two brand new Tesla Model 3. This amount, with compound interest, was what they would have to pay back for the rest of their lives. All while they would be trying to get an actual car of their own to go to work, have their own little apartment or house, and do exciting things like — eat.
  </p>
  <p className="about-p">
    Today, as an educator in a local college, I see firsthand many students graduating without employable skills. How can they ever pay off the amount of debt they owe? How can they ever live a rewarding life? I think there is no mystery — for many of them, they simply can’t, and they never will.  They are trapped for the rest of their lives.
  </p>

  <p className="about-p">
  This is the reason we started this school.
  </p>

  <p className="about-p">
  We would like to offer you, whether a student or a parent like me, a little different system, parallel to your routine life. We would teach you or your children a full-stack of highly marketable skills to avoid the life-long trap.
  </p>

  <p className="about-p">
  Here is how the system would work.
  </p>

  <p className="about-p">
  If you are busy, set aside a small block of time each week — maybe one or two evenings or days — to take a programming class with us. We will teach you how to build things from scratch — from simple web sites to complex web and mobile applications. We will teach you how to design the front-end and how to store and manage a large amount of data in the back-end.
  </p>

  <p className="about-p">
  If you have a summer off from high school, come to take an immersive AP Computer Science bootcamp. We will teach you everything to pass the AP exam. Its credits can be transferred into most colleges to save you money down the road. Or you may even take our immersive, 5 days a week, hands-on bootcamp for 8 weeks. You will learn the full-stack web development technologies both front-end and back-end. Upon completion, you will have built a portfolio of projects to show your passion and make you stand out from the crowd in your college applications.

  </p>

  <p className="about-p">
  If you’re thinking about a career change, you may consider our immersive, 15-week, bootcamp. Come talk to us. We will explain how.
  </p>

  <p className="about-p">
  You own your own destiny. You don’t have to lose sleep worrying about the future like I used to. Come travel with us on an exciting journey.

  <p className="about-p">
    As a software developer, I know how hard it is to become one. Whether it is
    a lack of training or funding, there are many hurdles one has to cross.
  </p>
  <p className="about-p">
    First, it’s hard to get into a Computer Science program in college. I remember when I wanted to major in CS, my counselor said, “Sorry, Said, you just don’t have enough math classes to be accepted”. That was tough for me to hear, especially when I had the passion in programming. Here are some real numbers to show how hard it is. There are about a thousand students who would like to major in CS every year at Stony Brook University, there are between 100 to 200 people who actually get in and graduate with a bachelor’s degree.
  </p>
  <p className="about-p">
    Second, even if you’re lucky enough to get into a CS program, it is still hard to learn the practical skills of coding. Most professors don’t code in class. Their mode of teaching consists of hours of mind-numbing powerpoint slides covering technologies already obsolete. It is hard for many people to learn like that. I, for example, tend to learn by designing algorithms, writing code, and building tangible modern web projects. I believe there are many like-minded people who learn this way.
  </p>

  <p className="about-p">
    Third, now suppose you’ve finished your CS degree and you would like to get a job in the industry. There are still code challenges standing between you and your dream job. If you don’t code a lot, your professors never showed you how to code properly, or your college is theory-oriented and not covering cutting-edge technologies used in the industry, you will have a hard time beating those challenges. Not to mention that you need extensive github repositories, a portfolio website, and a substantive resume to land interviews in the first place. Those are things that a traditional, selective, and expensive CS program typically fails to deliver but are most important to employers.
  </p>
  <p className="about-p">
    Fourth, what if you find your calling in coding after you’ve finished college or even graduate school, and you want a career change. You’ll be out of luck with most CS programs in the country. But our school would be happy to provide you with a learning opportunity. A community of coders in our school will help you reach your career goal.
  </p>

  <p className="about-p">
    This is why we designed our curricula this way. It’s hands-on and project-oriented. It focuses on a full-stack of technologies used currently in the industry.
